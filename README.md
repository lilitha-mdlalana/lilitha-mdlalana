## Hi, I'm Lilitha ! 👋

Welcome! I'm a dude in high school, 16 years old & I am studying to be a Full Stack Engineer. I study programming on my own although I'm not  a great(yet) programmer but I would like to. I code on a daily to try and improve my programming skills.

###  🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- My uncles startup as their Junior Mobile Developer

#### More about me: 
- 😣 Currently studying Flutter.
- 🪐 In love with the Dart programming languages.
- 🎧 I like to listen to music.

### Languages && Skills I know
- Dart & Flutter
- HTML & CSS
- Terminal 
- Figma
- JavaScript

### How I work  💻
I'm a person with an eye for good design so you will always find me trying to improve a webpage or an app trying to make it look and work better.

### ⚡ Fun fact: 
I am a generalist (a dabbler, an explorer, a learner — someone with broad knowledge across many topics and expertise in a few). I'm curious by nature threfore I'm always looking for opportunities to learn something new even though this can be a bad thing.
